## Code description
As part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS. I was assigned Task-2 API Testing with Postman focuses on understanding and validating RESTful web services using the Postman tool. In this task, the intern is required to send and analyze different types of API requests such as GET and POST to verify core functionalities like user authentication and data retrieval. The objective is to ensure that APIs respond correctly, return accurate data, and follow expected HTTP status codes. As part of the deliverables, a Postman collection containing the executed API requests must be created, along with proper documentation of test cases and results. This task helps in developing practical skills in API testing, improving knowledge of backend communication, and gaining hands-on experience in validating web services used in real-world applications.

## Objectives of the Task
To understand the basics of RESTful APIs and how they work.
To learn how to use Postman for sending and managing API requests.
To test API functionalities such as authentication and data retrieval.
To verify API responses using HTTP status codes, headers, and response bodies.
To ensure the accuracy, reliability, and correctness of API behavior.
To gain hands-on experience in creating and organizing Postman collections.
To document test cases and results clearly for validation and reporting purposes

## Tools and Technologies
Postman – Used to send, test, and validate RESTful API requests such as GET and POST.
RESTful APIs – Web services that follow REST architecture for data communication.
HTTP/HTTPS Protocol – Used for client–server communication over the web.
HTTP Methods – GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for performing different operations on APIs.
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) – Common data format used in API request and response bodies.
API Authentication Methods – Such as API keys, tokens, or basic authentication (as applicable).
Postman Collections – Used to organize and manage multiple API test cases.

## Test Scenario Covred
API Connectivity Test – Verify that the API endpoint is reachable and accessible.
Authentication Test – Validate login or token generation using valid and invalid credentials.
Authorization Test – Check access control by using authorized and unauthorized tokens.
GET Request Validation – Ensure data is retrieved correctly from the API.
POST Request Validation – Verify data creation with valid and invalid request payloads.
Response Status Code Verification – Confirm correct HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, etc.).
Response Body Validation – Validate the structure, fields, and values in the JSON response.
Header Validation – Check response headers such as Content-Type and Authorization.
Negative Testing – Test API behavior with missing, incorrect, or invalid inputs.
Error Handling Test – Ensure meaningful error messages are returned for failures.
Data Consistency Test – Verify that returned data matches the request parameters.
Performance Check (Basic) – Observe response time for API requests.

## Steps to execute the project
Install the Postman application on the system.
Launch Postman and log in or continue as a guest.
Create a new workspace or select an existing one.
Create a new collection to organize all API test requests.
Identify the API endpoints to be tested.
Select the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Enter the API endpoint URL in the request field.
Configure authorization details if the API requires authentication.
Add required headers such as Content-Type: application/json.
Provide request body data in JSON format for POST or PUT requests.
Click the Send button to execute the API request.
Verify the response status code and response time.
Validate the response body and headers against expected results.
Execute both positive and negative test scenarios.
Save each request and response in the Postman collection.
Export the Postman collection for submission.
Document the execution steps, test scenarios, and results in the README file.

## screenshots capture
Postman is used to test RESTful APIs.
A GET request is executed to fetch user details from the API.
The GET API returns 200 OK, which means the request is successful.
User data is displayed in JSON format in the response.
A POST request is executed to create new data using the API.
JSON data is sent in the request body (title, body, userId).
The POST API returns 201 Created, confirming data creation.
The response contains the newly generated ID.
These screenshots show successful data retrieval and data creation.
The task objectives of API testing using Postman are successfully completed.
